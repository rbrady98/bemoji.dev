Have you ever wanted to a simple way to implement a Go interface? If you wanted to do this in the past you would have had to use a tool like `impl` or in Neovim use `vim-go` which had a builtin command using this program.

In recent years this functionality is available directly in the Go LSP `gopls` but it is a little difficult to find. I found this out myself nestled in the comments of a `gopls` feature request on the projects Github Issues page.

## Implementing an interface through a code action

```go
type Dog interface {
	Bark()
}

type Animal struct {
	name string
}
```

To get the code action to appear we need to create a statement that will not compile because of the static type not does not implement the interface

```go
var dog Dog = Animal{} // error : Animal does not implement Dog (missing method Bark)
```

<InfoTip>

If you want to implement the method stubs for a pointer type you can use

```go
var dog Dog = new(Animal)
```

</InfoTip>

Now hovering the error in neovim and requsting code acions from the LSP you will see the option **Declare missing methods of Dog** and selecting it will result in the following:

```go
type Animal struct {
	name string
}

// Bark implements Dog.
func (a Animal) Bark() {
	panic("unimplemented")
}
```

We have generated the method stubs for the type using just the LSP, no third party tools necessary.
